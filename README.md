This is a Google Chrome Extension I quickly wrote this rainy Saturday while living in Texas. This will give you a random Chuck Norris joke in your Google Chrome web-browser. This extension is not available in the store. I do not want to pay to register to add this to the Google Chrome store for 1 thing, pluse who will really care to use this that much? 

If you want to install this on your own Google Chrome Web Browser you can! Please following these steps: 
0.) Download the files in this repo and put them in the same folder
1.) Click the 3 vertical dots, kebab, on the top right of your Google Chrome Web Browser. 
2.) In the menu that opens click "Extensions" and then click "Manage Extensions"
3.) Click "Load Unpacked" on the top left side of the web page. Then find the folder you put the files in (step 0) and select this folder.
4.) The extension is now installed. Click the puzzle piece at the top right. Then select the Chuck Norris Joke Machine. 
5.) Done. Congrats! Great job.
